    "# Rolling Disc From Scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this model developers tutorial on creating a rolling disc model from scratch using SymBRiM!\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a hands-on tutorial on your own models, connections, and load groups in SymBRiM. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have achieved the following learning goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create base classes for models and connections.\n",
    "- Create a submodel.\n",
    "- Create a parent model.\n",
    "- Create a connection.\n",
    "- Create a load group.\n",
    "\n",
    "The setup of this tutorial also aims to follow the style guide used in SymBRiM's source code to acustom you with the style expected by SymBRiM developers. An example is the obligated usage of docstrings and type hints in function signatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into this tutorial, it's recommended that you familiarize yourself with Objected Oriented Programming (OOP), SymPy, the architecture of SymBRiM (refer to the sections on _Software Overview_ to _BRiM Models_ in [the SymBRiM paper](https://doi.org/10.59490/6504c5a765e8118fc7b106c3)), and the [guidelines on implementing components in SymBRiM](https://mechmotum.github.io/symbrim/guides/component_implementation.html). This background information will provide valuable context for what we'll cover here.\n",

    "## Rolling Disc Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Shown below is a freebody diagram of the rolling disc we will model in this tutorial. The rolling disc is defined as an infinitesimally thin disc, rolling on the ground without lateral and longitudinal slip. The disc itself is defined with respect to the ground with a subsequent yaw-roll-pitch body-fixed rotation. Its contact point is defined to be in the ground plane at $q_1 \\hat{n}_x + q_2 \\hat{n}_y$ from the origin. As for the generalized speeds used in Kane's method, those are defined as $u_i = \\dot{q}_i$ for $i=1,...,5$. The ground is treated as the Newtonian body, the disc as a rigid body with a specified mass, inertia, and radius. To control the disc three time-varying torques are used: $T_{drive}$ acts about the rotation axis of the disc, $T_{steer}$ acts about the axis going through the contact point and the center of the disc, and $T_{roll}$ acts about the axis perpendicular to both the normal of the ground and the rotation axis.\n",

    "<center><img width=550px src=\"../_static/rolling_disc_fbd.svg\" alt=\"Freebody diagram of a rolling disc SVG\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Components Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "As depicted in the figure below, the rolling disc model (`RollingDisc`) consists of two models, one connection and a set of load groups. Each body is represented by a separate model, as the bodies are expected to be modular. In this case, we will model the ground as a flat ground (`FlatGround`), but one can also use a ground with a slope. The description of a ground in general is defined in the ground base class (`GroundBase`). The wheel model describes the inertial properties and the shape of the disc, in this case a knife-edge wheel (`KnifeEgeWheel`). To describe the interaction between the wheel and the ground, a nonholonomic tire model (`NonHolonomicTire`) is utilized. Reasons for using a connection are that the relation is rather complex to define in the parent model, `RollingDisc`, and it should also be modular and reusable in other parent models. We will use a load group to apply a driving, rolling, and steering torque (`RollingDiscControl`), we will apply gravity after creating the final system instance.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Tutorial Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is structured as follows. We start with an explanation of the implementation of both the abstract base class of the ground model as well as the implementation of the flat ground. Next, we continue with the implementation of the knife-edge wheel, while inheriting the abstract base class, `WheelBase`, from SymBRiM. With both submodels implemented, we will implement the tire base class and tire model, which uses nonholonomic constraints to enforce pure-rolling. Next, we will implement the overarching rolling disc model class. After which we create a load group to control the rolling disc. Finally, we will use our code to form the equations of motion (EoMs) of the rolling disc model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the classes implemented in this tutorial are simplified w.r.t. their implemention in the source code of SymBRiM. However, we will try to follow standards used in the development of SymBRiM, like type hinting.\n",

    "## GroundBase Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will delve into the implementation of the `GroundBase` class, which serves as the base class for defining the properties and methods shared by various ground models in SymBRiM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Base Class?\n",
    "\n",
    "A base class, such as `GroundBase`, plays a crucial role in SymBRiM by providing a common structure for related components. In the case of ground models, they share three essential properties and three methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three attributes defined in `GroundBase` are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `body`: Represents the rigid body associated with the ground.\n",
    "- `frame`: A reference frame fixed to the ground.\n",
    "- `origin`: The point that denotes the center of mass of the ground model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three methods prescribed in `GroundBase` are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `normal`: Property returning the normal vector of the ground.\n",
    "- `tangent_vectors`: Property returning the tangent vectors of the ground plane.\n",
    "- `set_pos_point(point, position)`: Sets the positions of a point relative to the origin\n",
    "\n",
    "These common attributes streamline the creation of different ground models. Subclasses, like the flat ground model we'll discuss, only need to implement specific methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: The actual implementation of the [GroundBase](https://mechmotum.github.io/symbrim/_autosummary/symbrim.bicycle.grounds.GroundBase.html) in SymBRiM is a bit different, as the normal vector and tangent vectors are positional dependent._\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, `GroundBase` creates a [System](https://docs.sympy.org/dev/modules/physics/mechanics/api/system.html#sympy.physics.mechanics.system.System) instance in the define objects stage, as any model or connection in SymBRiM must do. This [System](https://docs.sympy.org/dev/modules/physics/mechanics/api/system.html#sympy.physics.mechanics.system.System) instance is used to store all information, like bodies, joint, and generalized coordinates, such that these can later be retrieved in the [ModelBase.to_system()](https://mechmotum.github.io/symbrim/_autosummary/symbrim.core.base_classes.ModelBase.html#symbrim.core.base_classes.ModelBase.to_system) method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Define Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "In SymBRiM, the definition of a model is divided into several stages, ensuring the proper decoupling between components. These steps are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define connections**: This step enables parent models to associate submodels with their respective connections.\n",
    "2. **Define objects**: In this step, we create objects, such as symbols and reference frames, without defining any relationships between them.\n",
    "3. **Define kinematics**: We establish relationships between the objects, specifying their orientations, positions, velocities, and accelerations.\n",
    "4. **Define loads**: Here, we specify the forces and torques acting upon the system.\n",
    "5. **Define constraints**: The final step involves computing the holonomic and nonholonomic constraints to which the system is subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement the \"define\" steps in a model, connection, or load group, a leading underscore is added to the method name. For example, `_define_<step>`. These methods solely implement the \"define\" step for the component itself without traversing the submodels and load groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "[BrimBase](https://mechmotum.github.io/symbrim/_autosummary/symbrim.core.base_classes.BrimBase.html) contains the implementation of the \"define\" methods, including traversal, which should be called by the user. These methods follow the format `define_<step>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information refer to [the guidelines on implementing components](https://mechmotum.github.io/symbrim/guides/component_implementation.html#implementation-define-steps).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "As an exercise, complete the implementation of the `GroundBase` class, seen below, by implementing two specific properties: `origin` and `tangent_vectors`. The `origin` property should return the center of mass of the ground body, and the `tangent_vectors` property should be abstract."

    "## KnifeEdgeWheel Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, we don't need to create our own base classes; instead, we can leverage the existing ones provided by SymBRiM. In this section, we will implement a knife-edge wheel, which builds upon the [WheelBase](https://mechmotum.github.io/symbrim/_autosummary/symbrim.bicycle.wheels.WheelBase.html) class from SymBRiM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheriting from WheelBase\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the flat ground, the knife-edge wheel inherits from an abstract class, `WheelBase`. This time we will just use the one defined already in SymBRiM. `WheelBase` already defines a rigid body (`body`) and a body-fixed frame (`frame`) to represent the wheel. Additionally, it prescribes the implementation of two properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `rotation_axis`: A `Vector` representing the rotation axis.\n",
    "- `center`: A `Point` representing the wheel's center.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below, we will implement these two properties. The `center` property returns the center of mass as a `Point` to represent the center of the wheel, and the `rotation_axis` property returns the body-fixed Y-axis as a `Vector` to represent the rotation axis of the wheel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Symbol Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from defining these properties, we need to introduce a `radius` symbol to describe the shape of the wheel. In SymBRiM, we store symbols in the `symbols` dictionary created by [BrimBase](https://mechmotum.github.io/symbrim/_autosummary/symbrim.core.base_classes.BrimBase.html). This dictionary allows users to change a symbol after the \"define object\" stage, providing flexibility in symbol definitions. Here is a short example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "wheel = KnifeEdgeWheel(\"wheel\")\n",
    "wheel.define_objects()\n",
    "print(repr(wheel.symbols[\"r\"]))  # Prints Symbol(\"wheel_r\")\n",
    "wheel.symbols[\"r\"] = Symbol(\"my_r\")\n",
    "print(repr(wheel.symbols[\"r\"]))  # Prints Symbol(\"my_r\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, descriptions for symbols are stored in the `descriptions` property, which can be used for documentation purposes. `BrimBase.get_description` uses these properties to allow a user to request the definition of a symbol, e.g. `bicycle.get_description(wheel.symbols[\"r\"])` should return something like `Radius of the wheel.`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within SymBRiM's source code we use `BrimBase._add_prefix` to add the name of the instantiated model as a prefix to each symbol. This ensures that the symbols created among different models stay unique, assuming the user instantiates the models with unique names. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "wheel_rear = KnifeEdgeWheel(\"wheel_rear\")\n",
    "wheel_front = KnifeEdgeWheel(\"wheel_front\")\n",
    "wheel_rear.define_all()\n",
    "wheel_front.define_all()\n",
    "assert wheel_rear.symbols[\"r\"] != wheel_front.symbols[\"r\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information refer to [the guidelines on implementing components](https://mechmotum.github.io/symbrim/guides/component_implementation.html#define-objects).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the implementation of the `KnifeEdgeWheel` class by implementing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `center`: Define this property, which returns the center of mass as a `Point` to represent the center of the wheel.\n",
    "- `rotation_axis`: Define this property, which returns the body-fixed Y-axis as a `Vector` to represent the rotation axis of the wheel.\n",
