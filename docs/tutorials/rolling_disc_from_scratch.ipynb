    "# Rolling Disc From Scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this model developers tutorial on creating a rolling disc model from scratch using BRiM!\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a hands-on tutorial on your own models, connections, and load groups in BRiM. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have achieved the following learning goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create base classes for models and connections.\n",
    "- Create a submodel.\n",
    "- Create a parent model.\n",
    "- Create a connection.\n",
    "- Create a load group.\n",
    "\n",
    "The setup of this tutorial also aims to follow the style guide used in BRiM's source code to acustom you with the style expected by BRiM developers. An example is the obligated usage of docstrings and type hints in function signatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into this tutorial, it's recommended that you familiarize yourself with Objected Oriented Programming (OOP), SymPy, the architecture of BRiM, refer to the sections on _Software Overview_ to _BRiM Models_ in [the BRiM paper](https://doi.org/10.59490/6504c5a765e8118fc7b106c3), and the [guidelines on implementing components in BRiM](https://tjstienstra.github.io/brim/guides/component_implementation.html).

    "## Rolling Disc Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Shown below is a freebody diagram of the rolling disc we will model in this tutorial. The rolling disc is defined as an infinitesimally thin disc, rolling on the ground without lateral and longitudinal slip. The disc itself is defined with respect to the ground with a subsequent yaw-roll-pitch body-fixed rotation. Its contact point is defined to be in the ground plane at $q_1 \\hat{n}_x + q_2 \\hat{n}_y$ from the origin. As for the generalized speeds used in Kane's method, those are defined as $u_i = \\dot{q}_i$ for $i=1,...,5$. While the ground is treated as the Newtonian body, the disc has a specified mass, inertia and radius. To control the disc three time-varying torques are used: $T_{drive}$ acts about the rotation axis of the disc, $T_{steer}$ acts about the axis going through the contact point and the center of the disc, and $T_{roll}$ acts about the axis perpendicular to both the normal of the ground and the rotation axis.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Components Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "As depicted in the figure below, the rolling disc model (`RollingDisc`) consists of two models, one connection and a set of load groups. Each body is represented by a separate model, as the bodies are expected to be modular. In this case, we will model the ground as a flat ground (`FlatGround`), but one can also use a ground with a slope. The description of a ground in general is defined in the ground base class (`GroundBase`). The wheel model describes the inertial properties and the shape of the disc, in this case a knife-edge wheel (`KnifeEgeWheel`). To describe the interaction between the wheel and the ground, a nonholonomic tire model (`NonHolonomicTire`) is utilized. Reasons for using a connection are that the relation is rather complex to define in the parent model, `RollingDisc`, and it should also be modular and reusable in other parent models. We will use a load group to apply a driving, rolling, and steering torque (`RollingDiscControl`), we will apply gravity after creating the final system instance.\n",

    "## Tutorial Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is structured as follows. We start with an explanation of the implementation of both the abstract base class of the ground model as well as the implementation of the flat ground. Next, we continue with the implementation of the knife-edge wheel, while inheriting the abstract base class, `WheelBase`, from BRiM. With both submodels implemented, we will implement the tire base class and tire model, which uses nonholonomic constraints to enforce pure-rolling. Next, we will implement the overarching rolling disc model class. After which we create a load group to control the rolling disc. Finally, we will use our code to form the equations of motion (EoMs) of the rolling disc model.\n",

    "## GroundBase Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will delve into the implementation of the `GroundBase` class, which serves as the base class for defining the properties and methods shared by various ground models in BRiM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Base Class?\n",
    "\n",
    "A base class, such as `GroundBase`, plays a crucial role in BRiM by providing a common structure for related components. In the case of ground models, they share three essential properties and three methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three attributes defined in `GroundBase` are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `body`: Represents the rigid body associated with the ground.\n",
    "- `frame`: A reference frame fixed to the ground.\n",
    "- `origin`: The point that denotes the center of mass of the ground model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three methods prescribed in `GroundBase` are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `normal`: Property returning the normal vector of the ground.\n",
    "- `tangent_vectors`: Property returning the tangent vectors of the ground plane.\n",
    "- `set_pos_point(point, position)`: Sets the positions of a point relative to the origin\n",
    "\n",
    "These common attributes streamline the creation of different ground models. Subclasses, like the flat ground model we'll discuss, only need to implement specific methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: The actual implementation of the GroundBase in BRiM is a bit different, as the normal vector and tangent vectors are positional dependent._\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, `GroundBase` creates a `System` instance in the define objects stage, as any model or connection in BRiM must do. This `System` instance is used to store all information, like bodies, joint, and generalized coordinates, such that these can later be retrieved in the `ModelBase.to_system()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Define Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "In BRiM, the definition of a model is divided into several stages, ensuring the proper decoupling between components. These steps are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define connections**: This step enables parent models to associate submodels with their respective connections.\n",
    "2. **Define objects**: In this step, we create objects, such as symbols and reference frames, without defining any relationships between them.\n",
    "3. **Define kinematics**: We establish relationships between the objects, specifying their orientations, positions, velocities, and accelerations.\n",
    "4. **Define loads**: Here, we specify the forces and torques acting upon the system.\n",
    "5. **Define constraints**: The final step involves computing the holonomic and nonholonomic constraints to which the system is subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement the \"define\" steps in a model, connection, or load group, a leading underscore is added to the method name. For example, `_define_<step>`. These methods solely implement the \"define\" step for the component itself without traversing the submodels and load groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "`BrimBase` contains the implementation of the \"define\" methods, including traversal, which should be called by the user. These methods follow the format `define_<step>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information refer to [the guidelines on implementing components](https://tjstienstra.github.io/brim/guides/component_implementation.html#implementation-define-steps).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "As an exercise, complete the implementation of the `GroundBase` class, seen below, by implementing two specific properties: `origin` and `tangent_vectors`. The `origin` property should return the center of mass of the ground body, and the `tangent_vectors` property should be abstract."

    "## KnifeEdgeWheel Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, we don't need to create our own base classes; instead, we can leverage the existing ones provided by BRiM. In this section, we will implement a knife-edge wheel, which builds upon the `WheelBase` class from BRiM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheriting from WheelBase\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the flat ground, the knife-edge wheel inherits from an abstract class, `WheelBase`. This time we will just use the one defined already in BRiM. `WheelBase` already defines a rigid body (`body`) and a body-fixed frame (`frame`) to represent the wheel. Additionally, it prescribes the implementation of two properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `rotation_axis`: A `Vector` representing the rotation axis.\n",
    "- `center`: A `Point` representing the wheel's center.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below, we will implement these two properties. The `center` property returns the center of mass as a `Point` to represent the center of the wheel, and the `rotation_axis` property returns the body-fixed Y-axis as a `Vector` to represent the rotation axis of the wheel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Symbol Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from defining these properties, we need to introduce a `radius` symbol to describe the shape of the wheel. In BRiM, we store symbols in the `symbols` dictionary created by `BrimBase`. This dictionary allows users to change a symbol after the \"define object\" stage, providing flexibility in symbol definitions. Here is a short example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "wheel = KnifeEdgeWheel(\"wheel\")\n",
    "wheel.define_objects()\n",
    "print(repr(wheel.symbols[\"r\"]))  # Prints Symbol(\"wheel_r\")\n",
    "wheel.symbols[\"r\"] = Symbol(\"my_r\")\n",
    "print(repr(wheel.symbols[\"r\"]))  # Prints Symbol(\"my_r\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, descriptions for symbols are stored in the `descriptions` property, which can be used for documentation purposes. `BrimBase.get_description` uses these properties to allow a user to request the definition of a symbol, e.g. `bicycle.get_description(wheel.symbols[\"r\"])` should return something like `Radius of the wheel.`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within BRiM's source code we use `BrimBase._add_prefix` to add the name of the instantiated model as a prefix to each symbol. This ensures that the symbols created among different models stay unique, assuming the user instantiates the models with unique names. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "wheel_rear = KnifeEdgeWheel(\"wheel_rear\")\n",
    "wheel_front = KnifeEdgeWheel(\"wheel_front\")\n",
    "wheel_rear.define_all()\n",
    "wheel_front.define_all()\n",
    "assert wheel_rear.symbols[\"r\"] != wheel_front.symbols[\"r\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information refer to [the guidelines on implementing components](https://tjstienstra.github.io/brim/guides/component_implementation.html#define-objects).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the implementation of the `KnifeEdgeWheel` class by implementing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `center`: Define this property, which returns the center of mass as a `Point` to represent the center of the wheel.\n",
    "- `rotation_axis`: Define this property, which returns the body-fixed Y-axis as a `Vector` to represent the rotation axis of the wheel.\n",

    "## TireBase Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of the rolling disc model, the interaction between the wheel and the ground is complex and demands a modular design. To accommodate this, a new type of connection has been introduced to specify the tire model responsible for defining this interaction. This connection is facilitated by the abstract class `TireBase`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The implementation of tire model connections can be challenging, so if you find the details daunting, you can continue reading and return later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functionality Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The `TireBase` class provides several essential properties and methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ground`: A property that accepts any type of ground model, as long as it inherits from `GroundBase`.\n",
    "- `wheel`: A property that accepts any type of wheel model, as long as it inherits from `WheelBase`.\n",
    "- `contact_point`: A property that returns a `Point` to represent the contact point between the wheel and the ground.\n",
    "- `on_ground`: A boolean property that specifies whether the wheel is defined to always touch the ground or whether a holonomic constraint should be used. This boolean is by default `False`, but can be set to `True` by the parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "All other functionalities, such as computing the constraints and tire forces, are meant to be implemented in the define steps. For instance, the nonholonomic constraints should be set in `define_constraints` when implementing `NonHolonomicTire`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creation of Submodel Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "In BRiM, the class property `required_models` is used to specify submodel properties. `required_models` should be a tuple of `ModelRequirements`. Refer to [the implementation guidelines](https://tjstienstra.github.io/brim/guides/component_implementation.html#setting-submodels-and-connections) for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contact Point Computation\n",
    "\n",
    "Since most tire models require computing the contact point between the wheel and the ground, `TireBase` also implements `_set_pos_contact_point`. This protected method computes the contact point based on the types and properties of the ground and wheel. Once computed, it saves the location with respect to the wheel. It's important to note that this method should be called by the child class, e.g., `NonHolonomicTire`, as not every tire model may utilize this method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the following methods/properties in the `TireBase` class. Refer above for details on each of the properties.\n",

    "- Implement the `ground` and `wheel` properties using the `required_models` class attribute.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that we have all are key components implemted, we can create the `RollingDisc` model. While each of the components defines its own system, the job of the `RollingDisc` as parent model is to connect them. It has two submodels, ground and wheel, which it needs to connect. In this definition it should use our newly created tire connection as utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of implementing the `RollingDisc` class is to specify its submodels. Like with the connections, we can do so by specifying the class property `required_models` with `ModelRequirement`s. Required connections can be specified similarly using the class property `required_connections` with `ConnectionRequirement`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the structure set up we need to implement each of the define steps according to [the guidelines](https://tjstienstra.github.io/brim/guides/component_implementation.html#implementation-define-steps). In define connections we must associate the `wheel` and `ground` with the `tire` connection. \n",

    "- A `System` should be instantiated (as always).\n",
    "- The define step for each connection should be called.\n",
    "- The `on_ground` property of the tire should be set to `True` because we will define the contact point to be in the ground plane by definition not with a holonomic constraint.\n",
    "- Generalized coordinates and speeds must be created. The `RollingDisc` will use these to orient and position the wheel w.r.t. the ground. For each of these we should of course also make a description.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the define kinematics step `RollingDisc` has to define the wheel w.r.t. the ground. The orientation can be done using `ReferenceFrame.orient_body_fixed`, while setting the position of the contact point using `GroundBase._set_pos_point`. In this process it should also utilize the tire connection to establish some of the relationships. For details on the kinematics refer to the free body diagram at the top of this page. _Hint: do not forget to add the generalized coordinates, generalized speeds, and kinematical differential equations to the system._\n",
